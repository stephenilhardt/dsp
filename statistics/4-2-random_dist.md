[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

```
import numpy as np
import pandas

import thinkstats2
import thinkplot

random_list = np.random.random(size=1000)

print(random_list)
print(len(random_list))

random_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_list)
random_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_list)

print(random_cdf)
print(random_pmf)

thinkplot.Cdf(random_cdf)
thinkplot.Pmf(random_pmf)
```
The PMF plot suggests that all of the values in the random list have an equally likely outcome of occurring because the distribution is uniform, thus suggesting that the number generated by `random.random` is distinct from the numbers generated before it.

Looking at the CDF plot, we can see that the distribution tends to be linear, though not perfectly linear, which suggests that the percentiles may not reflect a perfectly even distribution. However, it could be the case that  adding more and more random numbers to the list would likely cause the distribution to approach something resembling perfect linearity.
